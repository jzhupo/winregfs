          Windows Registry FUSE Filesystem TODO list
          ------------------------------------------

* Fix issue where empty (default) value (@) can't be opened

* Fix 8 KiB file write limit issue (may really be in ntreg.c)
  For now an error is issued on attempts to write >8192 bytes
  since there are extremely few values that contain this much
  data; the XP compatibility shim cache is pretty much the
  only value of such a size (all others are <6000 bytes)

* Unicode and non-ASCII character support
  This is not only useful for non-Latin characters, it also
  can be used to find novel registry-resident malware such as
  Poweliks, which uses a non-ASCII name to block the Windows
  registry editor from being able to touch it.

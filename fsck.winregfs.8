.SH NAME
fsck.winregfs \- Check a Windows registry file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B fsck.winregfs
.I [-v] hivefile
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBfsck.winregfs\fP scans a Windows registry hive file for problems that 
indicate the hive has been damaged by hardware or software issues. If the 
\fI-v\fP option is specified, the program will output detailed information 
about the problems it finds.
.SH LIMITATIONS
\fBfsck.winregfs\fP works by recursively reading the key and value data
structures in the registry hive. Currently it does not read the actual data 
stored in a value, and due to the nature of the ntreg library's interfaces 
the checks are currently limited to reporting that errors exist; the details 
of the error conditions encountered are not broken down in the final output.
